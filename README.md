This is the public repository for the Ingress Magnus 2018 Trickster Archetype Portal Luminenance Project. The portal name is known as Misty's Mind Palace. Currently, the status of the project is complete.

## Electronics Overview
The Trickster PLP had several components that utilized electronics (in increasing order of complexity), all of which contain code to operate: 

* The two player puzzle -  used two 16x32 LED Matrices and two buttons connected to a Raspberry Pi 3 and a 5V switched mode power supply.
* The passcode puzzle - used a monitor and three rotary encoders with 3D printed knobs attached
* The main lighting -  A DMXKing USB device that supported six PAR lights daisy-chained to a DMX universe with 25 meter DMX cables
* The Physical Glyph puzzle - custom electronics and a microcontroller. The EAGLE schematics to all of the custom electronics may be found here.
